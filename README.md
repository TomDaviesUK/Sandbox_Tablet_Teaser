## Overview

This is a simple leaderboard display application, for presenting a user leaderboard of data, from a Google Sheet as the database, that I tied to a Google Form. the form then provides a simple way of capturing and displaying (this is the display piece!) of 'at event' challenge data.

It's essentially a GEAN stack (Node, Express, Angular, but Google Sheets for the database instead of MongoDB).

It uses the Model-View-Controller approach with some bootstrap 4, though it really doesn't need to use MVC, given the minimal complexity of the thing right now and it's purpose. But it was useful in case I want to expand it later.

It only has a single route right now - to the leaderboard of data.

If you wanted to use this, you would need to:

1. Create your Google Sheet and obtain it's ID
2. Enable the Google Sheets API for your account (Do step 1 of this article: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs)
3. Replace where I have `<MY SPREADSHEET ID>` with your sheet ID in the controller code.
4. Make sure you were retrieving the right range of data from your spreadsheet in the code just below that phrase, again in the controller file.

Once you've got that right, you just need to start the server - locally will do - just navigate to the top level folder once cloned and edited as above, then enter:

 `node server.js`

Then hit your browser at `localhost:8080`.

The first time that this is done, you'll be prompted to navigate to a given URL to generate a token, which will be used to authenticate this client against the google sheet. Then you should be in business!
